      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Bean There, Brew That was born from a love for coffee and a desire to
        create a space where people could come together, share stories, and slow
        down in today’s fast-paced world. It all began in 1995, when Giuseppe, a
        longtime coffee enthusiast, decided to turn their passion for brewing
        the perfect cup into something more meaningful. After years of traveling
        and tasting coffee from around the world, Giuseppe dreamt of opening a
        coffee shop that would not only serve exceptional drinks but also foster
        a sense of community and connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        We started with a small but cozy space in the heart of
        Gevgelija,Macedonia, with a simple goal: to make every cup of coffee an
        experience. From the very beginning, we’ve been committed to quality,
        sourcing our beans from local roasters who prioritize fair trade
        practices and sustainable farming. Our dedication to supporting ethical
        producers is at the heart of what we do, ensuring that every sip you
        take is both delicious and responsibly sourced.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        At Bean There, Brew That, we believe that coffee is more than just a
        drink—it’s a moment of connection, creativity, and comfort. Our mission
        is to serve not only the finest coffee but also to create an inviting
        space where everyone feels welcome, valued, and inspired. Whether you're
        here for a morning pick-me-up, a quiet afternoon to work, or a place to
        gather with friends, we strive to offer an experience that enriches your
        day and supports the local community.
      </p>

        We’re proud to offer a menu that celebrates the diversity of coffee
